    "A": "Article Friend is for researchers who want to make their research more accessible to individuals with
    aphasia."

    {
    "Q": "Who is Article Friend NOT for?",
    "A": "Article Friend is NOT currently intended for use by individuals without research expertise.
    Large language models, such as those used here, can often 'hallucinate' and misunderstand inputted texts.
    All output should be edited and verified by someone with research expertise before results are made public."

    "Q": "Why do you need to authenticate my Google account in order for me to use Article Friend? ",
    "A": "The output of Article Friend is currently output to Google Docs, which requires the authentication of a Google
    account.
    This authentication to Google is temporary, and Article Friend only has access to the document it produced.
    We do not store any information about your account."
